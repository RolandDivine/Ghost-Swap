# Ghost-Swap


# Gasless Layer 2

Gasless Layer 2 is a Solidity smart contract implementation of a gasless transaction layer for Ethereum. It allows users to perform gasless transactions by using off-chain signatures.

## Features

- Gasless transactions for both Ether and ERC20 tokens.
- Support for depositing and withdrawing Ether and ERC20 tokens.
- Integration with Uniswap for token swaps.
- Built-in signature verification to ensure transaction integrity.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and deploy the Gasless Layer 2 contracts on your local development environment.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version X.X.X)
- Hardhat (version X.X.X)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gasless-layer2.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd gasless-layer2
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

Before deploying the contracts, make sure to configure the network settings in `hardhat.config.js`. Update the desired network name, URL, and other parameters as needed.

### Deployment

To deploy the contracts to a local development network, run the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network development
```

### Usage

Once the contracts are deployed, you can interact with them using the provided contract interfaces.

See the `examples/` directory for sample code demonstrating how to use the Gasless Layer 2 contracts in your application.

### Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```
